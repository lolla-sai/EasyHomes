# EasyHomes
## A college web tech project built by our team (Me, Rounak Naik and Sairaj Naik). 

### Aim
The aim of the website is to simplify real estate. Be it buying (listing), selling, renting a property or anything along the lines you can do it on this. 

### Feautures
* We also added a packers and movers section, since the biggest hassle involved in a living space transition is the shifting itself.
* Google maps has been integrated into the website so properties can be located easily, if at all your prospective buyers want to drop in for a visit. 
* A comments section has been put in place under each property, just so people can rate a listed property.
* A markdown based text input is added, just in case user wants to specify their own styles for description box of the property.
* Best part, the website is fully responsive, as we know that mobile usage is increasingly growing.

### Security
Some security feautures like request before visit, get contact details etc have been added too. Authentication is required for performing some tasks like commenting on the post, listing properties etc.

### Tech Used
The entire website is built in HTML5, CSS3, JS (ES6), and PHP7 backend. 

### Learning Outcomes
While working on the project, we learnt how sessions, auth, databases and in general, how websites we see and use day in and day out, work.

### Website Link
You can find the website at https://easyhomes.000webhostapp.com/

### Side Notes
* While checking the website, you may get a 500 server error. This is because we are using the free tier of 000webhost which limits the bandwidth to 300mb among various other restrictions. It is not an error of the website, and can be fixed by reloading the website.
